After my initial studies in electronics, I decided to go into networking.
The network is an exciting world but you learn very quickly and the limits are reached very quickly. I was a network architect as a hobby, then I configured firewalls for companies.
Lets be honest, configuring firewalls is boring, so I decided to do something I really liked, which was to become a pentester.

The world of offensive security is exciting and I love learning a little more every day.
 
I currently work in cyber consulting at Deloitte where I do a lot of RedTeam and internal penetration tests.

I just finished my studies, I have an engineering degree (MsC) in network and security, so if you have a job to offer me why not. Contact me and we'll see together!
